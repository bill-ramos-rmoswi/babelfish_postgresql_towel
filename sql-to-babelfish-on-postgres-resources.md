## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Patterns

### Code Conversion Patterns

**T-SQL to PL/pgSQL Conversions**
- Variables and batch processing differences
- WAITFOR alternatives (pg_sleep)
- MERGE statement workarounds
- Dynamic SQL and temp tables

### Performance Optimization

**Memory Configuration**
- shared_buffers: 25% of RAM (vs SQL Server's dynamic allocation)
- work_mem: Per-operation memory (watch for multiplication across connections)
- maintenance_work_mem: For vacuum and index operations
- effective_cache_size: Query planner hint (doesn't actually allocate memory)

**Autovacuum Tuning**
- Understanding dead tuples and bloat
- Adjusting autovacuum thresholds for high-traffic tables
- Monitoring vacuum operations with pg_stat_user_tables

**Query Plan Management**
- Aurora PostgreSQL query plan management (apg_plan_mgmt)
- Using EXPLAIN and auto_explain
- Index optimization strategies

### Application Architecture

**Dual-Endpoint Strategy**
- Legacy apps ‚Üí TDS endpoint (port 1433) with T-SQL
- New development ‚Üí PostgreSQL endpoint (port 5432) with PL/pgSQL
- Gradual migration approach

**Connection Pooling**
- PgBouncer for connection management
- Differences from SQL Server connection handling

**Schema Naming**
- Single-database mode: Direct schema mapping
- Multiple-database mode: dbname_schemaname pattern

# babelfish_postgresql_towel
Bill Ramos's knowledge base for tips, tricks, and best practices for migrating SQL Server solutions to 
Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL with Babelfish, Babelfish for PostgreSQL, open-source WiltonDB for Windows, and PostgreSQL for SQL Server professionals.

According to the [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Fandom page](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Towel), 
>"Douglas Adams got the idea for the phrase 'knowing where one's towel is' when he went travelling and found that his beach towel kept disappearing. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts, his friends describe how he would always "mislay" his towel."

Think of this repository as your towel for all aspects of using Babelfish for migrating SQL Server applications and databases.

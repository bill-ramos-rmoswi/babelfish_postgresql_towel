# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Database Performance: Why Your T-SQL Functions are Probably Trying to Kill You   
   
## Subtitle: A Journey Through the Galaxy of Query Optimization, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Inline Calculations

Greetings, fellow travelers of the vast digital cosmos! As a Principal Solution 
Architect who's seen more poorly optimized databases than hot dinners, I come 
to you today with a warning of utmost importance. It's a tale of treachery, 
performance, and the seductive lure of T-SQL functions that could make even the 
most stoic DBA weep into their morning coffee.

Now, don't panic. I'm not here to tell you that the databases are about to be 
demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. No, the threat is far more 
insidious. It lurks in your code, masquerading as a helpful friend, all the 
while plotting to bring your carefully crafted queries to their knees. I speak, 
of course, of the dreaded T-SQL function anti-pattern.

## The Siren Song of T-SQL Functions

Picture, if you will, a C# developer. Let's call him Arthur. Arthur likes his 
code clean, his methods small, and his logic neatly encapsulated. One day, 
Arthur discovers T-SQL functions. "Aha!" he exclaims, "I can use these to 
simplify my database code!" And thus, with the best of intentions, Arthur sets 
forth on a path that leads to the dark side of database performance.

But fear not! For I have traversed the treacherous waters of query optimization 
and returned with a towel... er, I mean, with hard data to illuminate the path 
to righteousness.

## The Great T-SQL Function Experiment

To demonstrate the gravity of our situation, I conducted an experiment worthy 
of Trillian herself. But before we dive into the results, let's examine the 
culprits of our performance woes, shall we?

Much like the misguided programmers Lunkwill and Fook, who posed the great 
question to Deep Thought, our well-intentioned but misguided developers have 
created not one, but two nefarious functions. Behold, the source of our 
database's existential crisis:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.UT_CalcDivision(@dblNumerator FLOAT, @dblDenominator FLOAT)
RETURNS Float
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @return FLOAT
    DECLARE @CheckDivision Int
    SET @CheckDivision = dbo.UT_IsEqual(@dblDenominator, 0)
    
    IF @CheckDivision = 1
        SET @return = 0
    ELSE
        SET @return = @dblNumerator / @dblDenominator
    
    RETURN ROUND(@return, 2)
END
```

And its partner in crime:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[UT_IsEqual](@dblValue1 FLOAT, @dblValue2 FLOAT)
RETURNS Int
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @return Int
    DECLARE @dblSmall FLOAT
    SET @dblSmall = 0.000000000000001
    
    IF ABS(@dblValue1 - @dblValue2) <= @dblSmall 
        SET @return = 1
    ELSE
        SET @return = 0
      
    RETURN @return     
END
```

Oh, the horror! The nested calls! The unnecessary complexity! It's enough to 
make a Magrathean planet designer weep.

But fear not, for we have a hero in this tale: the inline calculation. Behold 
its elegance and simplicity:

```sql
CASE 
    WHEN ABS(Denominator) > 1E-10 THEN ROUND(Numerator / Denominator, 2)
    ELSE 0 
END
```

Now, let's put these contenders through their paces with five cosmic tests:

01. **The JOIN Juggernaut**: Optimizing JOIN operations with complex calculations
   
   Slow: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TableA a JOIN TableB b 
         ON dbo.UT_CalcDivision(a.Value, b.Value) = 42`
      
   Fast: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TableA a JOIN TableB b 
         ON CASE WHEN ABS(b.Value) > 1E-10 
                 THEN ROUND(a.Value / b.Value, 2) ELSE 0 END = 42`

10. **The ORDER BY Odyssey**: Improving ORDER BY clauses with calculated values
   
   Slow: `SELECT * FROM LargeTable 
         ORDER BY dbo.UT_CalcDivision(Column1, Column2) DESC`
      
   Fast: `SELECT * FROM LargeTable 
         ORDER BY CASE WHEN ABS(Column2) > 1E-10 
                       THEN ROUND(Column1 / Column2, 2) ELSE 0 END DESC`

11. **The SELECT * Saga**: Enhancing SELECT * queries with additional calculated columns
   
   Slow: `SELECT *, dbo.UT_CalcDivision(Value1, Value2) AS Result 
         FROM HugeTable`
      
   Fast: `SELECT *, CASE WHEN ABS(Value2) > 1E-10 
                        THEN ROUND(Value1 / Value2, 2) ELSE 0 END AS Result 
         FROM HugeTable`

100. **The Selective SELECT Sojourn**: Optimizing selective column retrieval with calculations
   
   Slow: `SELECT ID, Name, dbo.UT_CalcDivision(Salary, Hours) AS HourlyRate 
         FROM EmployeeTable`
      
   Fast: `SELECT ID, Name, CASE WHEN ABS(Hours) > 1E-10 
                               THEN ROUND(Salary / Hours, 2) ELSE 0 END AS HourlyRate 
         FROM EmployeeTable`

101. **The WHERE Clause Warp**: Enhancing WHERE clauses involving complex calculations
   
   Slow: `SELECT * FROM ProductTable 
         WHERE dbo.UT_CalcDivision(Price, Weight) > 10`
      
   Fast: `SELECT * FROM ProductTable 
         WHERE CASE WHEN ABS(Weight) > 1E-10 
                    THEN ROUND(Price / Weight, 2) ELSE 0 END > 10`

Now, brace yourselves for the results of our cosmic showdown:

These tests compare the performance between nested function calls, inline calculations in SQL Server, and the same optimizations in [Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/babelfish/).

Great galaxies! The nested function performance is so bad, it makes a Vogon 
poetry reading seem like a desirable alternative.

## Decoding the Cosmic Performance Gap

Let's break this down for our dear Arthur and his fellow C# enthusiasts:

1. The nested T-SQL function is slower than a sloth on sedatives. It's a 
   whopping 3.4 times slower than its inline SQL Server counterpart!

2. Babelfish on Aurora PostgreSQL, our plucky [open-source hero on GitHub](https://github.com/babelfish-for-postgresql), performs 
   admirably. It's 2.47 times faster than the nested function, though it does 
   lag behind the SQL Server inline approach by about 38%.

3. In the JOIN battle, Babelfish shines, being only 22% slower than SQL Server 
   inline but a whopping 31% faster than the nested function.

4. For SELECT operations without the wildcard, Babelfish even manages to edge 
   out SQL Server inline slightly. Impressive for an open-source contender!

## A Message to C# Developers: Achieve Query Transwarpification!

Attention, all C# developers! Your friendly neighborhood DBA has a gift for 
you. It's not a towel (though that would be useful too), but something even 
better: a way to achieve query transwarpification!

Here's what you need to do:

<instruction>
1. Copy your T-SQL code that uses nested functions.
2. Go to Claude.AI Sonnet 3.5 (https://claude.ai).
3. Paste the following prompt, followed by your code:

   "I'm a C# developer working with SQL Server. Can you help me optimize this 
   T-SQL code by replacing function calls with inline calculations? Please 
   explain the changes and how they improve performance."

4. Review Claude's suggestions and explanations.
5. Implement the optimized version in your code.
6. Marvel at your newly acquired database wizardry!
7. Thank your DBA profusely (preferably with their favorite caffeinated 
   beverage).
</instruction>

By following these steps, you'll not only improve your database's performance 
but also gain insights that will make you a better programmer than you already 
are. Remember, in the vast universe of database optimization, inline 
calculations are your hyperspace bypass to success!

## The Moral of Our Intergalactic Tale

Dear Arthur, and all you C# developers out there, heed these words:

1. T-SQL functions are not your friends. They're more like that overly 
   clingy acquaintance who always shows up uninvited and eats all your snacks.

2. Inline calculations are the way, the truth, and the light. They'll make your 
   queries zoom faster than the Heart of Gold with an Infinite Improbability 
   Drive.

3. If you're considering a move to the PostgreSQL galaxy, Babelfish on Aurora 
   PostgreSQL is a worthy steed. It offers competitive performance without the 
   commercial licensing costs of SQL Server. It's like getting a towel for free!

In conclusion, remember: DON'T PANIC, but do inline. Your databases will thank 
you, your users will praise you, and DBAs everywhere will sing songs of your 
glory. And if you ever find yourself tempted by the siren song of T-SQL 
functions, just think of poor Arthur and his 22-second query. May your queries 
be fast, your joins be efficient, and may you always know where your towel is.

So long, and thanks for all the fish... I mean, for ditching those T-SQL 
functions!
